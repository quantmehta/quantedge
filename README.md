**QuantEdge** is a high-performance portfolio management and decision-support system designed to bridge the gap between static spreadsheet tracking and dynamic, event-driven market analysis. It transforms raw portfolio data into actionable, multi-factor intelligence using a unique "Polyglot" architecture (Next.js + Python).

---

## 🚀 Mission

To empower individual investors with the same level of **Event Intelligence**, **Multi-Factor Sensitivity**, and **Autonomous Logic** used by billion-dollar fund managers. QuantEdge moves beyond simple P&L tracking to answer the critical question: *"How will the world affect my wealth today?"*

## 💎 Key Modules & Features

### 1. 📂 Autonomous Ingestion Engine
The entry point for your data. It doesn't just read files; it understands them.
*   **Dynamic Header Discovery**: Intelligent scanning of spreadsheets to find headers (Symbol, Qty, Price) regardless of row offsets, merged cells, or preamble noise.
*   **Flexible Schema Support**: Native support for exports from **Groww**, **Zerodha**, **Upstox**, and generic Excel formats (.csv, .xlsx, .xls).
*   **Bulk Persistence**: Optimized transaction-level processing for large portfolios (500+ instruments) with zero data loss.

### 2. 🧠 Multi-Factor Intelligence Hub
The brain of the system. It correlates your holdings with the outside world.
*   **Share-Level Analysis**: Recommendations are now individual (e.g., "TATA MOTORS: BUY") rather than just sector-wide.
*   **Contextual Reasoning**: Signals are generated by combining:
    *   **News Cycles**: Real-time sentiment analysis.
    *   **Policy Impacts**: Government announcements (e.g., MSP Hikes, PLI Schemes).
    *   **Historical Performance**: CAGR, Volatility, and Alpha tracking.
*   **Fund Manager Intel**: Python scripts analyze mutual fund manager behaviors to feed into the suggestion engine.

### 3. ⚡ Event Intelligence (Portfolio Maximizer)
Quantify the "What If?" scenarios.
*   **Stress-Testing**: Define market events (Macro, Geopolitical, Sector) and simulate their impact (e.g., "Crude Oil rises to $90").
*   **PnL-at-Risk**: Calculate exact downside exposure based on instrument sensitivity (Beta/Sector reliability/Direct correlation).
*   **Shock Matrix**: A real-time visualization of how different market shocks ripple through your portfolio.

### 4. 🤖 Decision Maker Chatbot
Structured thinking for complex choices.
*   **Deterministic Logic**: A rule-based conversational agent that guides you through specific decision frameworks.
*   **Game Theory Models**: Automatically computes:
    *   **Maximax**: The "Optimist" approach.
    *   **Maximin**: The "Pessimist" approach.
    *   **EMV**: Expected Monetary Value (Risk-Neutral).
    *   **Minimax Regret**: Minimizing the pain of the wrong choice.
*   **Audit Trail**: Keeps a strict log of every decision context, criteria, and computed outcome.

### 5. 📈 Live Market Integration
*   **Real-Time Data**: Seamless integration with the **Groww API** for fetching live Last Traded Prices (LTP).
*   **Fuzzy Resolution**: Robust symbol matching to handle discrepancies between broker export names (e.g., "Reliance Ind.") and API symbols (e.g., "RELIANCE").

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
*   **Node.js**: v20.x or higher
*   **Python**: v3.10+ (Ensure `python` and `pip` are in your PATH)
*   **Git**: Required for version control.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd decision-maker
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
**Frontend/Backend (Node.js)**
```bash
npm install
```

**Analysis Engine (Python)**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory. This is critical for the system to function.

```env
# Database Connection
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# Groww Integration (Live Data)
# Set to "true" to use mock data for testing without API keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_GROWW_MOCK="false" 
GROWW_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
GROWW_API_SECRET="your_api_secret_here"

# System Configuration
NODE_ENV="development"
```

### 4. Initialize Database
Generate the Prisma client and push the schema to your local SQLite database:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

### 5. Start the Engine
Launch the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Access the dashboard at: `http://localhost:3000`
