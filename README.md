# QuantEdge Portfolio Manager: Institutional-Grade Intelligence Hub

**QuantEdge** is a high-performance portfolio management and decision-support system designed to bridge the gap between static spreadsheet tracking and dynamic, event-driven market analysis. It transforms raw portfolio data into actionable, multi-factor intelligence.

---

## 🚀 Mission
To empower individual investors with the same level of **Event Intelligence**, **Multi-Factor Sensitivity**, and **Autonomous Logic** used by billion-dollar fund managers.

---

## 🏗️ Core Technology Stack

### **Frontend (The Interface)**
*   **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router)
*   **UI Essence**: Tailwind CSS 4 with a customized "Rich Aesthetic" theme (Gradients, Glassmorphism).
*   **Components**: Radix UI Primitives, Lucide React Icons.
*   **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions and state changes.
*   **Visualization**: Recharts for performance waterfall and sector bifurcation charts.

### **Backend (The Core)**
*   **Runtime**: Node.js 20+
*   **ORM**: Prisma 5 (SQLite for edge-compatible persistence).
*   **Logic**: Next.js Server Actions and API Routes.
*   **Validation**: Zod for runtime schema safety.

### **Data & Intelligence (The Brain)**
*   **Analysis Layer**: Python 3.10+ (Proprietary market trend algorithms).
*   **Live Connectivity**: Custom Groww SDK Adapter for real-time holdings and market context.
*   **Reporting**: Complex PDF generation via `pdfkit` and `jspdf-autotable`.

## 💎 Key Modules & Features

### 1. Autonomous Ingestion Engine (Phase 2 Focus)
*   **Dynamic Header Discovery**: Intelligent scanning of spreadsheets to find headers (Symbol, Qty, Price) regardless of row offsets or preamble noise.
*   **Flexible Schema Support**: Handles .csv, .xlsx, and .xls formats from various brokers (Groww, Zerodha, etc.).
*   **Bulk Persistence**: Optimized transaction-level processing for portfolios with 500+ instruments.

### 2. Multi-Factor Intelligence Hub
*   **Share-Level Analysis**: Recommendations are now individual (e.g., "TATA MOTORS: BUY") rather than just sector-wide.
*   **Contextual Reasoning**: Signals are generated by combining News Cycles, Policy Impacts (e.g., MSP Hikes, PLI Schemes), and Historical Performance.
*   **Decision Matrix**: Automatically identifies realized P&L and cost-averaging for sold/partially-sold holdings.

### 3. Event Intelligence (Portfolio Maximizer)
*   **Stress-Testing**: Define market events (Macro, Geopolitical, Sector) and simulate their impact.
*   **PnL-at-Risk**: Calculate exact downside exposure based on instrument sensitivity (Beta/Sector/Direct).
*   **Shock Matrix**: A real-time visualization of how different market shocks ripple through your portfolio.

### 4. Groww Integration & Live Context
*   **Live Data Sync**: Fetches current market prices and instrument details.
*   **Fund Manager Intel**: Python scripts analyze fund manager behaviors to feed into the suggestion engine.
